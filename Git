 Git : Distributed version control and collaboration.
 	   Some example of version control system are:
 	   		1. bitkeeper ( old )
 	   		2. gitlab
 	   		3. github 
 	   		4. git and many more
 
 		1. Version Control
 		2. Collaboration
 		
 		- Every New update will be store as a new file.
 		- Can be back and for to its version.
 		- Track record of update can be shown easily.
 		- Easy to collaborate with multiple people in single project
 		
 		# Different Types Of: Version Control System
 		--------------------------------------------
 		
 		1. Local Version Control
 			- We can create a local database to store all the version. 
	 		- But we can not be able to collaborate with other. 
	 		: to solve this issue, we have the system called CVCS ( Centralized Version Control System )
 		
 		2. Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
 		
 			layer : Server -> Repository -> ( update and commit ) -> working copy ( separately for each developer )
 		
 		# Advantage of (CVSC): 
 		----------------------
 			Every one have access to it. Group will know that on which topic we are working. 
 			Makes easy to communicate.
 			
 		# Disadvantage of (CVSC):
 		-------------------------
 			File gone a replace by on commit
 			
 			
 		3.Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):
 		--------------------------------------------
 			layer : Server > Repository > local repository > working copy
 		
 		** Open Source Project : Anyone can contribute to the project.
 		
 		# History:
 		----------
 			Early days: Archive files or Sending the patches are mostly used
 			linux was using the gitkeeper. linux is free community open source. when gitkeeper start charging then they move to git.
 			In this way the git was born.
 			
 			Advantage of git:
 			1. Simple to use
 			2. Fast
 			3. Branching
 			4. Fully distributed Which make the git so famous.
 			
 		
	Can be work with GUI or CUI.
	* CUI = more control flow and more recommended to work with.
	
	
	************************************ Intalling Git ( working directory and local branch .git ) *********************************
	NOTE: # = command line, don't put the # in the command 
	
	- to know the git is installed or not
		# git --version
		
		[ Note: In mac (Xcode) git is already installed. Windows: we have to install ]
		
		# git download > select the right version for your os > download
		
		* move with all the default configuration or you can change it according to your own.
		
		- After installing, we have to make the user who will gone a work together
		# git config
		
		- user name have to mentioned
		- Email Must have to config to git
		
		- to get all the variable 
		# git config --global --list
			- show you all the detail of your account. username, email, repository
			
		- if you don't have git account, configure it with below command
		# git config --global user.name "name"
		# git config --global user.email "email"
		
		- conform the same command
		# git config --global --list
		- show user.nama, user.email
		
		
		- [ working directory(git don't know of working directory) > commit(goes to staging area) > staging area(git work and take care of file) ]
		- Think as every time, we commit = we create one version of that file or code
		
		// to know the status of git 
		# git status
			-fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
				- meaning git does not have repository yet
				
				
		// we have to create a git Local repository ( meaning we have to initialize the git )
		// below command create the empty Git repository folder is hidden but all the staging will be done here
		# git init
			
			- show the file path of git repository.
			- Remember that all the created file will be the part of project(working directory) but not part of .git
		
		// check the git status
		# git status
		
		NOTE: we want to have the " On branch main " , Not a " On branch master "
		To do that we have to remove the git
		# rm -rf .git
		or( go to directory > select the folder .git > shift + delete)
		# git init 
			- by default give the master directory
		
		// to get main
		# git init -b main   // -b = branch
		
		// check git status
		# git status
